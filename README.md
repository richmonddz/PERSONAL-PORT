# PERSONAL-PORT

This is my personal portfolio that I will add projects to as I progress and improve my skills as a software developer.

This project was to display different project that I have worked on and to show what I have learened in my second week of the bootcamp. It consisted of different CSS styles and techniques like hover, box sytling, nav bar and responsive design. While working on the project the main issue I came across was the responsive layout. I may have to reformat my html so it is eaiser to target specific sections of the webpage. Included in the website is a functioning nav bar, a linked image to the the project (Project.1) and styling options using "hover".
